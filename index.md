### Goal
We propose a novel neural metric information retrieval system trained according to an original self-supervised method on the large unsupervised corpus of COVID19 papers, called CORD19. Self-supervision means without requiring a priori the set of queries with their relevant papers. It overcomes the strong lack of supervised datasets, whose creation is time-consuming and requires large human experts’ efforts. We have fully implemented and put online the solution1to help medical research organizations in fighting the pandemic.  We have compared our solution with the state-of-the-art reaching similar or better results, but with the following contributions: (i) our approach is an original self-supervised method based on papers’ bibliography, thanks to which we do not need any labelled datasets (ii) we use significantly fewer parameters, estimated as an order of magnitude lower than competitors, thus using largely cheaper hardware resources.  The work includesthe evaluation of our solution using the TREC-COVID evaluation set, whose papers we fully removed fromCORD19.  We provide all passages required to reproduce our solution and highlight the contribution to theresult accuracy for each of the main component
